*A theme is what sets the layout and design of a website and a framework adds functionality and structure to a theme.*

The Identity Experience Framework (IDX Self-Hosted) allows you to deploy LoginRadius directly onto your page quickly. It will enable you to customize some standard layout options to bring it in line with the branding of your sites while preserving the ability to leverage all of the functionality of the full LoginRadius JS deployment.

2.Customizability - Design an interface tailored to the look and feel of your app.

3.Self-contained and straightforward front-end implementation - With the Login Screen configuration section of the Admin Console, you can create a complete login screen from start to finish.
